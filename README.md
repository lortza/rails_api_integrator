# Rails API Integrator

[![Maintainability](https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/51fd012d7d70a11a1edc/maintainability)](https://codeclimate.com/github/lortza/rails_api_integrator/maintainability)

This is a Rails API that consumes several different APIs and outputs a new product that's a compilation of that data.

* Ruby 2.5.0
* Rails 5.2.0
* Postgres
* JSON-API formatting with `gem 'jsonapi-rails'`
* Runs on port 3001 (localhost:3001)

This API is presently consumed by the React App [react_rails_api_city_data](https://github.com/lortza/react_rails_api_city_data)

## Features

API that provides data for a city name search. Results include:

  - today's weather for the provided city
  - weather for nearby cities
  - Flikr photos from that city
  - news stories for that city
  - events in that city for the next 30 days
  - consistent DateTime formatting for Events and Articles (ex: `2018-05-19 22:46:58`)

#### Incorporated APIs

All of these APIs have a free tier.

* [GeoDB](http://geodb-city-api.wirefreethought.com/docs/guides/getting-started/test-drive) (requires Credit Card #, but does not charge it)
* [weatherunderground](https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/d/docs?d=index)
* [New York Times](https://developer.nytimes.com/)
* [flickr photo search](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/)
* [Eventful](http://api.eventful.com/docs)

## Getting Started

To run this locally, start `rails server` then browse to:

```
http://localhost:3001
```

This API is not hosted anywhere, so you will also need API keys for all of the APIs listed above in order to run it locally.

## Endpoint

The endpoint takes state and city parameters.

```
http://localhost:3001/reports/tx/austin
```

Cities with spaces in the name are okay too.

```
http://localhost:3001/reports/la/new orleans
```

## Data Output

Data is separated into 4 main sections:

```
weather
articles
events
photos
```

### Sample Output

Output is formatted in `jsonapi` with the help of `gem 'jsonapi-rails'`.
