# Rails API Integrator

This is a Rails API that consumes several different APIs and outputs a new product that's a compilation of that data.

* Ruby 2.5.0
* Rails 5.2.0
* Postgres
* JSON-API formatting with `gem 'jsonapi-rails'`
* Runs on port 4517 (localhost:4517)

## Getting Started

To run this locally, start `rails server` then browse to:

```
http://localhost:4517
```

## Features

API that provides data for a city name search. Results include:

  - today's weather for the provided city
  - weather for nearby cities
  - photos of that city
  - news stories for that city
  - events in that city for the next 30 days

#### Incorporated APIs

* [GeoDB](http://geodb-city-api.wirefreethought.com/docs/guides/getting-started/test-drive)
* [weatherunderground](https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/d/docs?d=index)
* [New York Times](https://developer.nytimes.com/)
* [flickr photo search](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/)
* [Eventful](http://api.eventful.com/json/events/)

## Endpoint

The endpoint takes state and city parameters.

```
http://localhost:4517/reports/tx/austin
```

Cities with spaces in the name are okay too.

```
http://localhost:4517/reports/la/new orleans
```

## Data Output

Data is separated into 4 main sections:

```
weather
articles
events
photos
```
